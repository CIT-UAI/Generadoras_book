  abstract = {The province of Ouarzazate has a population of 10,744 and is divided into 17 communes (15 rural communes and 2 urban communes), the majority of which have a population of less than 2000 people. Currently, more than 42\% of the total population does not have access to a controlled landfill that meets all the socioenvironmental criteria defined by Law 28-00 and its implementing regulations. The most typical landfills are located in small villages that resemble illegal dumps or dark areas close to the inhabitants. Moreover, in 2009, a controlled landfill was established near the city of Ouarzazate. Over time, urban extensions tend to move towards the site of the landfill following the development plans of the city, which influences the environmental life and health of the new population. Indeed, this landfill is considered to be located in the wrong place according to the results of our study; it does not meet all the main socio-environmental criteria. For these reasons, this study was conducted to identify appropriate landfill sites and waste transfer centers using geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing coupled with multi-criteria evaluation techniques such as AHP. Eleven criteria were selected, including distance to protected areas, wind direction, subsurface geology, lineament density, distance to surface water (river systems and dams), soil quality, distance to roads, elevation, and slope. The rasters of all the criteria were prepared, processed, and overlaid in the GIS environment by assigning each parameter its weight according to its importance. In the field, five sites have been provisionally selected, but only sites D and B have been given higher priority because of their geographical location, large surface area, geological imperviousness, zero risks, better soil quality, distance from any protection zone, any water point or hydrographic network, and their accessibility by provincial roads. These sites are located very close to the province's waste hubs, which helps reduce the cost of transporting waste to the new landfill.},

  abstract = {Waterlogging as a perennial problem is deep rooted on the urban fabrics of English Bazar Municipality. The present 10 study pertains to vulnerability and risk assessment of flood and waterlogging susceptible areas in a micro or local scale, based on an integrated Analytic Hierarchy Process-Geographic information System (AHP-GIS) category model. For this purpose, a multi-criteria assessment of natural, quasi-natural and man-made factors have been performed. Criterion includes six parameters namely elevation, slope, soil, flow accumulation, land use land cover, density of digitized drain network which are responsible to initiate the waterlogged condition within municipality premises. The weights of all criterion are computed by 15 pair wise comparison decision matrix (AHP). According to their weightage, information of different parameters is superimposed for a final weighted overlay analysis following a spatial modelling, under ArcGIS 10.5 platform to delineate the flood and water logging susceptible zones. The result obtained from this study indicate 11.45\%, 3.05\% and 85.49\% area of municipality corresponds with highly vulnerable, low and moderately vulnerable respectively. The major finding in the study reveals that unplanned urban expansion in the hazardous low-lying area by filling up of wetlands and depressions in association 20 with inadequate drainage gravity provisions in the newly built-up wards (3, 23, 24 and 25) are noteworthy for resultant waterlogging condition. The present paper also aims to suggest long-term mitigation measures to be well integrated for arriving at a well drafted and implementable comprehensive drainage plan of English Bazar municipality.},

Due to haphazard urbanization, poor fire services, few and old fire engines, insufficient skilled human resources combined with narrow road lanes, clustered households increase the fire vulnerability in Kathmandu Metropolitan City. This paper documents the fire station suitability zonation mapping in Kathmandu Metropolitan City using Group Decision Making Process (GDMP) in the GIS interface. Four different selection criteria factors such as distance from roads, land cover, distance from rivers and population density are considered for analysis and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used for Group Decision Making Process (GDMP). The results reveal that only 13.46\% of the study area is highly suitable for fire station location. Hence, the fire station suitability zonation map is trustworthy and can be used for the construction of new fire stations in Kathmandu Metropolitan City.},

  abstract = {Landslides are one the most destructive and life-endangering hazard in the Darjeeling Himalayan region and keeping in mind the interest of society and their future prospects identification of landslide potential areas is a very pertinent task in this area. Therefore, the present study aimed toward the landslide susceptibility zonation (LSZ) mapping in and around the Kalimpong region by applying Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method integrated with fifteen causative factors including slope, lineament, drainage density, land use land cover, relative relief, soil texture, lithology, elevation, aspect, thrust and faults, plan curvature, profile curvature, road network, topographic wetness index and stream power index. Tolerance and variance inflation factors with Pearson's correlation coefficient are used to assess potential collinearity among the selected factors, and subsequently, the final model has been constructed by enduring an acceptable consistency ratio ({$<$}0.10). Thereafter, to classify this region into very low, low, moderate, high and very high susceptible zones quantile, geometric interval, Jenk's natural break and success rate curve (SRC) techniques are adopted to compare and check the optimum LSZ categorization. Considering the identified 647 landslides, Area Under Curve (AUC) of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is used to gauge the best LSZ map. The AUC ROC shows SRC method (m = 0.9) yields the highest result, achieving a prediction accuracy of 79.5\% and, therefore, is considered the most promising LSZ form for the present study area. The results obtained from the study highlight the spatial information of areas that may face slope instability and helps government agencies, stakeholders for drafting adequate measures due to absence of proper landslide early warning systems in this region.},

In order to achieve this, a data model is defined and a multi-criteria decision methodology, based on an analytical hierarchy process, is applied. In contrast to the previous studies, in which the spatial analysis was undertaken by a GIS managing different layers of information (grids, shapefiles, etc.), in this work the spatial analysis is carried out by means of an open-code spatial database management system: PostgreSQL-PostGIS. This system uses Structure Query Language to manage different tables in the context of relational spatial databases. The case study is the province of Seville (southern Spain), where this sort of facility already exists. The empirical analysis concludes that a large percentage of the province of Seville has an excellent potential for the installation of photovoltaic plants. The methodology allows the dynamic updating of criteria and parameters, as well as the reproducibility, scalability and automating of analyses carried out in other fields.},

  abstract = {Mapping groundwater recharge zones (GWRZs) is essential for planning artificial recharge programs to mitigate groundwater decline and saltwater intrusion into coastal aquifers. We applied two multi-criteria decision-making approaches, namely the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and the multi-influencing factors (MIF), to map GWRZs in the Korba aquifer in northeastern Tunisia. GWRZ results from the AHP indicate that the majority (69\%) of the area can be classified as very good and good for groundwater recharge. The MIF results suggest larger (80.7\%) very good and good GWRZs. The GWRZ maps improve groundwater balance calculations by providing estimates of recharge-precipitation ratios to quantify percolation. Lithology, land use/cover and slope were the most sensitive parameters followed by geomorphology, lineament density, rainfall, drainage density and soil type. The AHP approach produced relatively more accurate results than the MIF technique based on correlation of the obtained GWRZs with groundwater well discharge data from 20 wells across the study area. The accuracy of the approaches ultimately depends on the classification criteria, mean rating score and weights assigned to the thematic layers. Nonetheless, the GWRZ maps suggest that there is ample opportunity to implement aquifer recharge programs to reduce groundwater stress in the Korba aquifer.},
